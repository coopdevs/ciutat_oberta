## Open Food Network

---

### What is it?

Collaborative network of local projects

<br>
*Australia, UK, France, Skandinavia, Canada, Katuma, USA*

Coming: *Belgium, Germany*

---

### Shared vision

*Support the development of short/local food systems*

two-level governance: local and global

---

### Software as a common resource

It is an infrastructure and not a tool

Developed globally, offered locally

---

### Single core team

Devs/PO/QA from all local projects

Reduces operational costs

Lowers barrier cost for new instances

---

### Single money pot

We bring in grants, crowdfunding, etc. from the local projects

We prioritize together

**Multiplier** effect

---

### Diverse local business models

Instances explore possibilities in parallel

Will there be a *one size fits all*?
